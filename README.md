# howtoplay
 HowToPlay is an interactive, simple game where the object of the game is to figure out how to progress. In other words, how to play.

Current version: 0.0.1
- Added first component 'Game' which currently just displays "test" when rendered.
- Added three unit tests to see if the initial title renders, whether the start game button is enabled, and whether or not pressing the button renders the Game component.
